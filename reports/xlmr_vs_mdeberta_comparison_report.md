- Concentrated excellence on fewer emotions

## Deployment Recommendations

### Choose XLM-RoBERTa if:
- **Training speed** is important
- **Accuracy** is the primary metric
- **Broader emotion coverage** is needed
- **Balanced precision-recall** is preferred

### Choose mDeBERTa if:
- **F1-score optimization** is the primary goal
- **High recall** is critical (e.g., detecting negative emotions)
- **Focused performance** on key emotions is acceptable
- **Slightly better precision** is important

## Statistical Significance

Based on test set performance (655 samples), the difference in F1-score between models (35.69% vs 33.74% = 1.95pp) is relatively small. Both models show:
- **Comparable performance** within statistical margin
- **Similar threshold optimization benefits**
- **Consistent validation-test generalization**

## Conclusions

### Overall Winner: **Context-Dependent**

**For Production Systems:**
- **mDeBERTa** recommended for **recall-critical applications** (detecting negative sentiment, safety-critical emotions)
- **XLM-RoBERTa** recommended for **accuracy-critical applications** and **resource-constrained environments**

### Key Findings:
1. **Both models benefit dramatically from threshold optimization** (+175-203% F1 improvement)
2. **Performance gap is narrow** - model selection should be based on specific requirements
3. **Persona token integration works effectively** for both architectures
4. **Training efficiency favors XLM-RoBERTa** (23% faster)
5. **Generalization is robust** for both models (validation ≈ test performance)

### Next Steps:
1. **Ensemble approach** combining both models could capture strengths of each
2. **Task-specific optimization** - different models for different emotion categories
3. **Production A/B testing** to validate real-world performance differences
4. **Cross-validation** on additional test sets to confirm findings
