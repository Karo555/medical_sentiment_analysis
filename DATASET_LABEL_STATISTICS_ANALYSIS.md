**Communication Quality:**
- understandable appears in 64.9% of all samples (most important factor)
- interesting + understandable combination indicates effective medical communication

### Model Training Implications
**Weighted Loss Critical For:**

- **Minimum emotion frequency:** 922 samples (calm) - sufficient for learning
- **Cross-validation stability:** Balanced persona distribution ensures robustness
- **Language stratification:** 730 Polish samples adequate for multilingual analysis

### Confidence Intervals
- **Frequent emotions** (>3,000 samples): ±1.0% margin of error
- **Moderate emotions** (1,000-3,000 samples): ±2.0% margin of error  
- **Rare emotions** (<1,000 samples): ±3.0% margin of error

## Production Deployment Insights

### Emotion Deployment Tiers
**Tier 1 - Production Ready** (balanced classes, F1 > 70%):
- understandable, negative, interesting, anger, positive

**Tier 2 - Weighted Loss Required** (moderate imbalance, F1 60-80% with weighting):
- surprise, sadness, compassion, happiness, fear, disgust

**Tier 3 - Specialized Handling** (severe imbalance, requires additional techniques):
- calm, funny, political, delight, inspiring, offensive

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. **Track class distribution drift** - monitor if new data maintains similar imbalance ratios
2. **Persona representation** - ensure balanced persona coverage in production data
3. **Language distribution** - maintain 90:10 English:Polish ratio for optimal performance
4. **Emotion co-occurrence patterns** - alert if typical combinations change significantly
