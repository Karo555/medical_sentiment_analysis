- **Good performance** on professional descriptions (Examples 2, 9)  
- **Challenges** with emotionally complex cases (Examples 3, 4, 8)
- **Effective** cross-language performance (Example 10)

The weighted loss implementation specifically addresses the class imbalance visible in these examples, where emotions like `calm` (rare) and `funny` (rare) appear infrequently but are crucial for comprehensive medical sentiment understanding.
