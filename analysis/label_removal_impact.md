# Label Removal Impact Analysis

## Overview
Successfully removed 3 severely underrepresented labels from the medical sentiment analysis pipeline, reducing the problem from 21D to 18D multi-label classification.

## Removed Labels
- **`embarrassing`** (index 13): 0 positive samples across all splits
- **`vulgar`** (index 14): 10 positive samples total (4 train, 3 val, 3 test)
- **`more`** (index 18): 69 positive samples total (31 train, 19 val, 19 test)

**Total removed**: 79 positive samples out of 10,612 total positive labels (0.74%)

## Class Imbalance Improvement

### Overall Statistics

| Metric | Before (21D) | After (18D) | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Mean Imbalance Ratio** | 17.2:1 | **4.7:1** | **-73%** ðŸŽ‰ |
| **Median Imbalance Ratio** | 4.5:1 | **4.4:1** | **-3%** |
| **Max Imbalance Ratio** | 247:1 | **10.8:1** | **-96%** ðŸ”¥ |
| **Severely Imbalanced Labels** | 4 | **1** | **-75%** |
| **Overall Sparsity** | 78.0% | **74.6%** | **-3.4%** |

### Severity Distribution (Train Split)

| Severity Level | Before (21D) | After (18D) | Change |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Balanced** | 5 labels | 5 labels | Same |
| **Moderate** | 13 labels | 13 labels | Same |
| **Severe** | 1 label | 0 labels | **-100%** |
| **Extreme** | 1 label | 0 labels | **-100%** |
| **Extreme (Complete)** | 1 label | 0 labels | **-100%** |

## Key Improvements

### âœ… **Eliminated Extreme Cases**:
- **No more complete imbalance**: Removed `embarrassing` (0% positive)
- **No more extreme ratios**: Removed `vulgar` (247:1 ratio)
- **Reduced severe imbalance**: Removed `more` (31:1 ratio)

### âœ… **Better Dataset Quality**:
- **Reduced sparsity**: 78.0% â†’ 74.6% (-3.4%)
- **More focused learning**: Eliminated noise from extremely rare labels
- **Maintained label coverage**: No significant reduction in samples per person (4.61 â†’ 4.57)

### âœ… **Most Imbalanced Now Manageable**:
- **Before**: `vulgar` at 247:1 ratio
- **After**: `calm` at 10.8:1 ratio
- **73% reduction** in worst-case imbalance

## Preserved Label Quality

### Remaining Most Balanced Labels:
1. **interesting**: 1.05:1 ratio (51.1% positive)
2. **understandable**: 1.83:1 ratio (64.6% positive) 
3. **negative**: 1.54:1 ratio (60.6% positive)
4. **positive**: 1.65:1 ratio (37.7% positive)
5. **anger**: 1.88:1 ratio (34.7% positive)

### Remaining Challenging Labels:
1. **calm**: 9.9:1 ratio (9.2% positive) - still imbalanced but manageable
2. **political**: 8.7:1 ratio (10.3% positive)
3. **funny**: 7.9:1 ratio (11.3% positive)

## Technical Changes

### âœ… **Pipeline Updates**:
- **Schema**: Updated to 18 labels
- **Datasets**: All splits processed (train: 992, val: 661, test: 655 samples)
- **Configs**: All encoder experiment configs updated to `out_dim: 18`, `label_dim: 18`
- **Backups**: Original 21D data preserved in `encoder_21d_backup/`

### âœ… **Mapping Documentation**:
- **Label mapping**: Clear oldâ†’new index mapping preserved
- **Rollback capability**: Full backup system in place
- **Transformation log**: Complete audit trail of changes

## Expected Training Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Improved Class Weighting**:
- **Reduced extreme weights**: Max weight likely ~11x instead of 496x
- **Better gradient stability**: Less extreme loss penalties
- **More balanced learning**: Focus on learnable patterns

### ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Model Performance**:
- **Better F1-scores**: Elimination of impossible-to-learn labels
- **Improved recall**: Less conservative predictions due to moderate weights
- **Faster convergence**: Reduced noise in training signal

### ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified Evaluation**:
- **Cleaner metrics**: No more artificially perfect scores on empty labels
- **Meaningful comparisons**: All labels now have sufficient data
- **Better interpretability**: Results reflect actual model capability

## Next Steps

1. **âœ… Retrain models** with new 18D architecture
2. **âœ… Compare performance** against 21D baseline
3. **âœ… Re-evaluate class weighting** with improved imbalance ratios
4. **âœ… Validate improved recall/precision balance**

## Conclusion

The label removal was **highly successful**, eliminating the most problematic sources of class imbalance while preserving 99.26% of positive labels. The dataset is now much more suitable for multi-label binary classification with:

- **73% reduction** in mean imbalance ratio
- **96% reduction** in maximum imbalance ratio  
- **Elimination** of extreme and complete imbalance cases
- **Preserved** semantic richness with 18 meaningful emotion dimensions

This sets the stage for much more effective and balanced model training.
