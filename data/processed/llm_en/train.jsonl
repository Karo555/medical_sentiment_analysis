Unfortunately, after the septum surgery, a perforation appeared, which the doctor promised to stitch during another procedure. However, this never happened, and I only learned about the significant enlargement of the perforation much later. I feel disappointed and let down because I trusted that the issue would be resolved. Today, the perforation makes my life very difficult, causing discomfort and risking further damage to the septum. I understand that this is a rare complication, but the way it was handled left a bitter taste.

The mere thought of having to go there was terrifying, but the horror truly began in the office. The doctor made me feel worthless, criticizing how I could neglect my teeth like that, etc. Throughout the entire visit, she kept criticizing me, and with such behavior, she intensified my fear of dentists even more. I couldn't recover the whole day\u2014I cried a lot and think her attitude harmed my baby and me more than the bad tooth did. I never want to see her again and will definitely not visit that clinic anymore.

We are refugees from Ukraine, and perhaps that\u2019s why this woman was so unpleasant toward us\u2014or maybe she is just a very unkind person in general. Either way, I cried on the way home because the entire appointment was pure horror and stress. During the visit, both my husband\u2014the biological father of our child\u2014and I felt like spoiled schoolchildren being scolded. The doctor either mocked us, made sharp, sarcastic remarks, or clutched her head and lamented, 'God, how you\u2019ve ruined this child, how terrible all of this is.' And all of this, mind you, in front of the child! Then, she incorrectly commented on the fact that the child does not live with the mother, and we had to explain why\u2014even though it was absolutely none of her business. There are no words to fully describe the situation, but we will be deeply traumatized for a very long time.\n", "target_text": "{labels:[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]}"}

It would have been best if my visit ended right after entering the office. Only after my persistent questions about whether we could do something today since I had already visited the office, I was offered scaling and other maintenance procedures, during which it turned out that there was indeed one tooth requiring serious treatment. When I asked if there was anything else to address, I was told everything was fine and no intervention was needed, and that I should return in six months. Now, another doctor (also from Luxmed) has listed several more teeth that require attention. It's hard for me to interpret this as anything other than reluctance to care for a subscription-based client. Ms. Marzena is probably an excellent specialist, as the service was performed very well, but the fact that I lived for half a year under the impression that my teeth were in good condition really irritated me.\n", "target_text": "{labels:[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]}"}

I live in Gliwice, yet for several years now, I've been treating my problematic teeth only with Mr. Rafa\u0142 in \u017bory because, in Gliwice, most dentists would rather extract teeth immediately instead of bothering to save a tooth with little chance of survival\u2014or they'd quote such high prices that it makes you feel faint on the spot. My enamel is very fragile, I have too many root canals, plus wisdom teeth, and everything is tightly packed together. Despite this, I have a beautiful smile, my fillings don't fall out, and I always leave the office very satisfied. The best part? When the Doctor sculpts a tooth with those drills, you can't even tell the difference between the healthy teeth and the filled ones. That's what I call perfectionism at work :) I haven\u2019t found such professional help at such a reasonable price anywhere in Gliwice.

My joy from the visit lasted only as long as the anesthetic was working. For three days in a row, I visited the office with severe tooth pain. Of course, I had to pay 200 PLN for each visit. Instead of taking an X-ray during the first visit (despite having the capability), the doctor began treating my tooth at random. My entire right side was in pain, so I couldn\u2019t pinpoint which tooth was the problem. Naturally, it led to root canal treatment. After three days, the doctor assured me that the pain would be gone. However, if anything happened, I could freely message him. When the anesthetic wore off, the severe pain returned. Unfortunately, the doctor never responded. I went to another dentist, and after an X-ray, it turned out that the sixth tooth needed treatment\u2014it was the source of the pain. The tooth (the seventh one) that the doctor performed a root canal on was actually healthy. Due to the poorly performed service by this doctor, I now need root canal treatment on two teeth.\n", "target_text": "{labels:[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]}"}

I visited Dr. Jankowska to have two teeth filled. It was one of my worst visits at Luxmed (Fabryczna). The doctor was aware of my condition\u2014that I was pregnant\u2014yet for nearly 35 minutes, I lay with my head tilted back, choking on saliva and tooth fragments without a single opportunity to rinse my mouth or even close it for a moment. The anesthesia I received was painful compared to my previous visit with another doctor. The numbness lasted about 4 hours, during which I couldn't even drink water, let alone eat, unlike my previous experience with another dentist. Additionally, while applying the filling and holding my tooth with a metal insert, Dr. Jankowska accidentally brushed her apron against the screw, injuring my lip, which was extremely unpleasant. I also constantly felt like the doctor was leaning over me; when I left the office, my head looked as if I had just woken up from a night's sleep. Overall, I would not recommend Dr. Jankowska to anyone\u2014in fact, I would strongly advise against it.
