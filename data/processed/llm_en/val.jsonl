The numbness lasted about 4 hours, during which I couldn't even drink water, let alone eat, unlike my previous experience with another dentist. Additionally, while applying the filling and holding my tooth with a metal insert, Dr. Jankowska accidentally brushed her apron against the screw, injuring my lip, which was extremely unpleasant. I also constantly felt like the doctor was leaning over me; when I left the office, my head looked as if I had just woken up from a night's sleep.

However, this never happened, and I only learned about the significant enlargement of the perforation much later. I feel disappointed and let down because I trusted that the issue would be resolved. Today, the perforation makes my life very difficult, causing discomfort and risking further damage to the septum.

The mere thought of having to go there was terrifying, but the horror truly began in the office. The doctor made me feel worthless, criticizing how I could neglect my teeth like that, etc. Throughout the entire visit, she kept criticizing me, and with such behavior, she intensified my fear of dentists even more. I couldn't recover the whole day—I cried a lot and think her attitude harmed my baby and me more than the bad tooth did.

My joy from the visit lasted only as long as the anesthetic was working. For three days in a row, I visited the office with severe tooth pain. Of course, I had to pay 200 PLN for each visit. Instead of taking an X-ray during the first visit (despite having the capability), the doctor began treating my tooth at random. My entire right side was in pain, so I couldn’t pinpoint which tooth was the problem. Naturally, it led to root canal treatment. After three days, the doctor assured me that the pain would be gone. However, if anything happened, I could freely message him. When the anesthetic wore off, the severe pain returned. Unfortunately, the doctor never responded. I went to another dentist, and after an X-ray, it turned out that the sixth tooth needed treatment—it was the source of the pain. The tooth (the seventh one) that the doctor performed a root canal on was actually healthy. Due to the poorly performed service by this doctor, I now need root canal treatment on two teeth.\n", "target_text": "{labels:[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]}"}
