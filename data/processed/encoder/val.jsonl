I trusted her—several years ago, I underwent two surgeries with her: nasal septum correction and removal of the adenoids. Both procedures went smoothly, and the communication was professional and to the point. Unfortunately, after the septum surgery, a perforation appeared, which the doctor promised to stitch during another procedure. However, this never happened, and I only learned about the significant enlargement of the perforation much later. I feel disappointed and let down because I trusted that the issue would be resolved. Today, the perforation makes my life very difficult, causing discomfort and risking further damage to the septum. I understand that this is a rare complication, but the way it was handled left a bitter taste. I’m not saying the doctor is a bad physician—on the contrary, I value her knowledge and experience.
