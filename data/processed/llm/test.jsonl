The doctor was aware of my condition—that I was pregnant—yet for nearly 35 minutes, I lay with my head tilted back, choking on saliva and tooth fragments without a single opportunity to rinse my mouth or even close it for a moment. The anesthesia I received was painful compared to my previous visit with another doctor. The numbness lasted about 4 hours, during which I couldn't even drink water, let alone eat, unlike my previous experience with another dentist. Additionally, while applying the filling and holding my tooth with a metal insert, Dr. Jankowska accidentally brushed her apron against the screw, injuring my lip, which was extremely unpleasant. I also constantly felt like the doctor was leaning over me; when I left the office, my head looked as if I had just woken up from a night's sleep. Overall, I would not recommend Dr. Jankowska to anyone—in fact, I would strongly advise against it.

My entire right side was in pain, so I couldn’t pinpoint which tooth was the problem. Naturally, it led to root canal treatment. After three days, the doctor assured me that the pain would be gone. However, if anything happened, I could freely message him. When the anesthetic wore off, the severe pain returned. Unfortunately, the doctor never responded. I went to another dentist, and after an X-ray, it turned out that the sixth tooth needed treatment—it was the source of the pain. The tooth (the seventh one) that the doctor performed a root canal on was actually healthy.

From the moment we entered, we felt a warm and friendly atmosphere. Ms. Bożena is a person full of empathy, passion, and vast knowledge, which she conveys clearly and concretely. It wasn't a \"rigid consultation\" but an inspiring meeting after which we left with our heads full of knowledge and motivation. The biggest surprise was my skeptical boyfriend, who after the conversation suggested a healthy breakfast himself! For me, that was a miracle and proof that Ms. Bożena can reach anyone. No judgment, no pressure—just understanding, an individual approach, and full professionalism. She patiently answered every question with a smile. If you're hesitating, there's nothing to think about. She is a specialist with heart and passion. I wholeheartedly recommend 10/10!\n", "target_text": "{\"labels\":[0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]}"}

She said I could come back every two months but didn’t explain why. I was alarmed by her warning that if my \"leg starts to give out,\" I should return immediately, but she didn’t clarify what that meant.

An NHS visit in an atmosphere of rush, nerves, zero empathy, calmness, or observation of what's happening. The child is supposed to cry, sob uncontrollably, develop petechiae from crying—then it's good because it strengthens the abdominal muscles. The half-hour visit took place entirely in screams, sobbing, etc. Our little boy cried like a cat, the lady didn’t react, she just continued. She provided a whole list of problems, diagnosed by her, undermining the work of a series of doctors. Overall, she gives the impression of someone who knows everything—better and more than doctors, and certainly more than the parent. The next child after us was also sobbing uncontrollably, unable to calm down—we and the entire corridor heard it.

Dr. Joanna Golińska is an incredibly empathetic, dedicated, and patient-focused doctor. I came to her with a rather unusual situation and left with tears of relief in my eyes because she took care of all the needs I had. She listened to my entire medical history, referred to it, took a detailed medical history, made notes, took photos, and issued recommendations. I felt she genuinely cared about helping me, not just physically but also mentally. An approach I unfortunately rarely experience. It's clear that this is a profession she practices with a calling—she has immense knowledge and an ease in conveying it in an accessible way.
